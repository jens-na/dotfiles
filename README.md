Overview
====
This is the repository where I keep selected files of my dotfiles. The
repository is inspired by [holman/dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles).

The files are topic-centric (such as ruby, vim, git)

Installation
====
To install my dotfiles on your system, you can use the following
commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jens-na/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
script/bootstrap
```
